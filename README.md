# Web for school
(If this text is in Polish or any other language than English please turn off automatic translation. I don't recommend that)

Here I store my tasks involving **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS** and **PHP** issued by my teachers from different subjects.
I use the `DD.MM.YYYY` date format. Function names, variables, comments etc. are in English (unless the teacher wants me to use Polish), but everything printed on the console or the page is written in Polish. I can translate if you need to.

**Please do not just copy and paste my code if you want to use it for school**. 
I've decided to make it open source only to help people learn off examples.  
(I hope my teacher won't accuse me of stealing my own code if he finds this lol)
